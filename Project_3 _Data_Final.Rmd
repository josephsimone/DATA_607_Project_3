# Project # 3 - Data Scienctist Skills Compared

### Objective
This is a project for your entire class section to work on together, since being able to work effectively on a virtual team is a key “soft skill” for data scientists. Please note especially the requirement about making a presentation during our first meetup after the project is due.

W. Edwards Deming said, “In God we trust, all others must bring data.” Please use data to answer the question, “Which are the most valued data science skills?” Consider your work as an exploration; there is not necessarily a “right answer.”


### Background 

When researching for this project, this study https://365datascience.com/research-into-1001-data-scientist-profiles/, has findings that fits the critia needed to be calculated in order to complete this project. However, as a team, we needed some sort of data pool to start calulating perameters to answer a research question(s).

```{r, include=TRUE }
imgage <- "C:/Users/jpsim/Documents/DATA Acquisition and Management/journal.png"
include_graphics(imgage)
```

With some futher research, we found a similar project that wanted to answer a similar question. 


https://www.kaggle.com/discdiver/the-most-in-demand-skills-for-data-scientists


```{r, include=TRUE }
imgage <- "C:/Users/jpsim/Documents/DATA Acquisition and Management/kaggle.png"
include_graphics(imgage)
```

For this project we used the two main data-sets from the above kaggle web-page to answer our research question(s)

kaggle_ds_job_listing_software.csv & kaggle_ds_general_skills_revised.csv


```{r, include=TRUE }
imgage <- "C:/Users/jpsim/Documents/DATA Acquisition and Management/kaggle_data.png"
include_graphics(imgage)
```


```{r}
 general_skills <- read_csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephsimone/DATA_607_Project_3/master/kaggle_ds_general_skills_revised.csv")
head(general_skills)
```


```{r}
software_skills <-read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephsimone/DATA_607_Project_3/master/kaggle_ds_job_listing_software.csv")
head(software_skills)
```

## Research Question

##### What are the most important Techology based skill and Soft Skill, respectively, when hiring a Data Scientist?

##### Overall, what is the most sought after skill for a Data Scientist? 


## Data import and cleaning

As a team, we thought it be best to join these two data-sets, cleaning the respective data-frames into similar formats to be merged. 

```{r}
dt1 <- as_tibble(general_skills, key = "ï..Keyword")
dt1$Skill_Set <- "Soft"
dt2 <- as_tibble(software_skills, key = "ï..Keyword")
dt2$Skill_Set <- "Tech"
dt2 <- select(dt2,-c(6,7,8,9,10,11,12))
```


## Combine Data-frames
```{r}
result<-rbind(dt1, dt2)
```


## Explore newly created data-frame
```{r}
head(result)
```


## Rename variable 
```{r}
names(result)[names(result) == "ï..Keyword"] <- "Keyword"
```

## Export to .csv
```{r}
write.csv(result, file = "joined_df2.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```


## Importing newly created csv
```{r}
#ds_skills <- read_csv("joined_df2.csv")
ds_skills <- read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephsimone/DATA_607_Project_3/master/joined_df2.csv")
head(ds_skills)
```


## Data-frame cleaning and tidying

```{r}
ds_skills$Total <- rowSums(sapply(ds_skills[,c(2:5)], as.numeric))
ds_skills <- mutate(ds_skills[, c(1,6,2:5,7)])
ds_skills <- data.frame(ds_skills)
colnames(ds_skills)

```



## Creation of New Variable 

These two combined data-sets used the amount of keywords present during a general search on well known job recruitment websites, to fill in its' values. As a team, we thought it was more effective to create an average out of these values to get a better understanding of the dataset.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
LinkedIn <- 8610
Indeed <- 5138
SimplyHired <- 3829
Monster <- 3746
Total <- LinkedIn + Indeed + SimplyHired + Monster
ds_skills$LinkedIn <- ((ds_skills$LinkedIn)/(LinkedIn))*100
ds_skills$Indeed <- ((ds_skills$Indeed)/(Indeed))*100
ds_skills$SimplyHired <- ((ds_skills$SimplyHired)/(SimplyHired))*100
ds_skills$Monster <- ((ds_skills$Monster)/((Monster)))*100
ds_skills$Total <- ((ds_skills$Total/((Total))))*100
dim(ds_skills)
head(ds_skills)
```
